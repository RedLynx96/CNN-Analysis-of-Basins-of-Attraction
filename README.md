# üåÄ Deep Learning-Based Analysis of Basins of Attraction üåÄ

This repository contains the tools and resources for analyzing basins of attraction using deep learning techniques. We explore fractal dimension, basin entropy, boundary basin entropy, and the Wada property through neural network-based methods. Feel free to explore our work, where we provide an in depth explanation of our findings.

## üìö Available Scripts

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Basin_predictor.py**
This script provides a GUI to compute metrics for basins of attraction from a `.csv` file containing precomputed basins.

- **Usage**:  
  - Open the GUI by running the script:
    ```bash
    python Basin_predictor.py
    ```
  - Load a `.csv` file with the basins' routes, an example folder and dataset is provided.  
  - The script calculates metrics such as fractal dimension, basin entropy, and more.  
  - Results are saved in a new `.csv` file.

- **Visualization**:  
  - Basins can be visualized within the GUI. A demonstration GIF is included in the repository for reference.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Basin_Metric_Training.py**
This script allows training a new CNN model.  

**Note**: Training a new model requires a large dataset of basins. Pre-trained weights are provided in `models/`.

- **Usage**:  
  - Train a new model:
    ```bash
    python Basin_Metric_Training.py
    ```
  - Use the pre-trained weights for analysis:
    - Weights are available in `models/`.
